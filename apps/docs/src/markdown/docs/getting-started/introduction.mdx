# Introduction

Welcome to the Hiko UI documentation!

Hiko UI is a minimalist React component library powered by Tailwind CSS, designed for fast and scalable UI development.

---

## What is Hiko UI?

Hiko UI is a [**React**](https://react.dev/) component library that enables you to build accessible, elegant, and responsive user interfaces with ease.  
Built on top of [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), it provides a highly customizable design system out of the box.

The core goal of Hiko UI is to accelerate the frontend development process while maintaining visual consistency and flexibility across your application.

## Design Principles

Hiko UI is built around three core principles:

- **Minimal API Surface** – Easy to learn, use, and integrate into any React project.
- **Design Consistency** – Enforces visual harmony across components through a shared design token system.
- **Full Customizability** – Built on Tailwind CSS, allowing complete control over themes, styles, and behavior.

## Who is Hiko UI for?

Hiko UI is ideal for:

- Frontend developers building modern web applications with React.
- Teams who prefer Tailwind CSS but want prebuilt, accessible components.
- Design system authors looking for a scalable and maintainable UI foundation.
